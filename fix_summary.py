COMPREHENSIVE FIX VERIFICATION
Advanced Algorithm Stop Loss Update Issue

PROBLEM: User reported stop loss showing 706 instead of 736 when price reached 739
SOLUTION: Fixed trailing logic to always update stop loss when price increases

BEFORE FIX: Stop loss only updated when new_stop_loss > highest_stop_loss
AFTER FIX: Stop loss always updates when price increases (correct behavior)
